<br>
<br>
Current Status:
<br>
Improved accuracy from 43% to 80% (with rf & hyper parm optimization)
<br><br>

Techniques used:
<br>
tfidf - extract information
<br>
k-means - extract categorical feature
<br>
Multinomial Logistic regression
<br>
Support Vector Machine Classifier
<br>
Naive Bayes Classifier
<br>
K- Nearest Neighbors 
<br>
Random Forest (best accuracy 80%)
<br>
<br>
Further Steps (> 80% optimizations are more time intensive):
<br>
Include other ensemble methods
<br>
Use neural nets
<br>
Extract/include more features
<br><br>
Notes:
<br>
Including k means cluster improves accuracy by only ~1%
