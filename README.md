Document Classification (Reuters Dataset)

Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/reuters-21578+text+categorization+collection

Current Status:
Improved accuracy from 43% to 80% (with rf & hyper parm optimization)

Techniques used:
tfidf - extract information
k-means - extract categorical feature
Multinomial Logistic regression
Support Vector Machine Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier
K- Nearest Neighbors 
Random Forest (best accuracy 80%)

Further Steps (> 80% optimizations are more time intensive):
Include other ensemble methods
Use neural nets
Extract/include more features
